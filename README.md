# IAL

## Introduction

The aim of this IAL is to enable basic communication between people who do not share a language. It does this by providing a small vocabulary and virtually no grammar. This enables rapid use of the language, as anyone can use the grammar of their native language. The near-lack of grammar sacrifices clarity for ease of use.

The vocabulary is taken from the world's most-spoken languages.

## Phonology

(This section probably needs some fixing up as I am not 100% with the notation and lots of it is tentative anyway)

Consonants: ```/m k~g~x j p~b w n t~d s~z/```

Vowels: ```/a~α i~e u~o/```

Orthography: m k j p w n t s a i u

All words are either V, CV, CVCV, CVCVCV or VCV - this allows for exactly 14499 words.

No consonant or vowel clusters under any circumstances
