# IAL

## Introduction

The aim of this IAL is to enable basic communication between people who do not share a language. It does this by providing a small vocabulary and virtually no grammar. This enables rapid use of the language, as anyone can use the grammar of their native language. The near-lack of grammar sacrifices clarity for ease of use.

The vocabulary is taken from the world's most-spoken languages.
